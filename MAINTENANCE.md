# Maintenance Guide

This document is for **"Future Me"** to remember how this repository works and how to manage the content.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main entry point for the website.
- **`css/style.css`**: The stylesheet with the Premium "Dark Mode" design.
- **`js/app.js`**: The logic for search, sorting, and the modal popup.
- **`js/data.js`**: Use `window.SESSIONS_DATA` to store all session info. **Do not edit this manually**; it is generated by the script.
- **`scripts/generate_sessions.py`**: The magic script that reads your folders and builds `data.js`.
- **`sessions/`**: Where all the content lives.

## How to Add a New Session

You don't need to touch the code to add content. Just follow this standard process:

1.  **Create a Folder**:
    Go to `sessions/` and create a new folder following the pattern `session_NNN` (e.g., `session_052`).

2.  **Add Your Files**:
    Inside that folder, create the following text files:

    *   **`video.txt`** (Required): Just paste the YouTube URL.
        ```text
        https://youtu.be/example-id
        ```

    *   **`name.txt`** (Optional but recommended): The title of the session.
        ```text
        52-The Title of My Session
        ```

    *   **`urls.txt`** (Optional): Any extra links you want to share. Format is `Title: URL`.
        ```text
        Official Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com
        Cool Tool: https://example.com
        ```

    *   **`Files.zip`** (Optional): If you have files to share, just drop the zip file in the folder.

3.  **Push to GitHub**:
    By default, there is a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/update.yml`) that watches for changes.
    -   Just `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
    -   The robot will run `generate_sessions.py` for you and update the website live.

## Local Testing

If you want to check how a session looks before pushing:

1.  Add your folder and files as above.
2.  Run the script in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python scripts/generate_sessions.py
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Customization Notes

-   **Colors**: defined in `root` of `css/style.css`.
-   **Icons**: Using inline SVGs in `index.html` and `app.js`.

# The Sunday Gaming Learning

Welcome to **The Sunday Gaming Learning** repository! This is a unique space where learning meets gaming, designed to rekindle the curiosity and creativity within every individual. Here, you will find resources and downloads related to my video sessions that cover a wide range of topics, particularly focusing on Excel, Power Query, and data analysis.

Every child is unique, but as we grow into adults, our inner child often fades away, along with our uniqueness and curiosity to learn. **The Sunday Gaming Learning** is on a mission to awaken that inner child in you through engaging and fun learning sessions that don't require the conventional 10,000 hours of practice to master.

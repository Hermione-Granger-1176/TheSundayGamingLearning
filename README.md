# The Sunday Gaming Learning

Welcome to **The Sunday Gaming Learning** repository! This is a unique space where learning meets gaming, designed to rekindle the curiosity and creativity within every individual. Here, you will find resources and downloads related to my video sessions that cover a wide range of topics, particularly focusing on Excel, Power Query, and data analysis.

## Why This Repository Exists

Every child is unique, but as we grow into adults, our inner child often fades away, along with our uniqueness and curiosity to learn. **The Sunday Gaming Learning** is on a mission to awaken that inner child in you through engaging and fun learning sessions that don't require the conventional 10,000 hours of practice to master.

## What You Will Find Here

### Video Sessions
I regularly upload video sessions that cover various topics. Here are some of the themes explored in the repository:

- **Excel Mastery:**
  - Techniques and tips to master Excel efficiently.
  - Practical examples and case studies to enhance your skills.

- **Power Query Techniques:**
  - In-depth tutorials on using Power Query.
  - Advanced functions and real-world applications.

- **Interactive Challenges:**
  - Fun and engaging challenges to test your knowledge.
  - Opportunities to apply what you've learned in practical scenarios.

- **Community Engagement:**
  - Sessions where members share their experiences and insights.
  - Collaborative learning and peer support.

### Resource Links
In addition to video sessions, the repository also includes links to useful resources and documents that complement the learning experience.

## How to Update Sessions

The repository automatically generates the `index.md` file from the session folders. To add or update sessions:

### Adding a New Session

1. Create a new folder in `sessions/` named `session_NNN` (e.g., `session_052`)
2. Add the following files to the folder:
   - **`video.txt`** (Required): Contains the YouTube video URL
   - **`name.txt`** (Optional): Contains the session name with numeric prefix (e.g., `52-My Session Title`)
   - **`urls.txt`** (Optional): Contains additional resource links in `Title: URL` format (one per line)
   - **`Files.zip`** (Optional): Session materials for download

3. Push the changes to the `main` branch - the workflow will automatically regenerate `index.md`

### Updating an Existing Session

To update any existing session, simply modify the files in its folder (e.g., `sessions/session_001/`) and push to `main`. The workflow will automatically detect changes in the `sessions/` directory and regenerate `index.md`.

### File Formats
